# Proyecto_Final_PA_Shell


Shell Programming Project

Open the terminal to unpack and decompress the file.
Execute the file by navigating to the Proyecto_Final folder using the cd command with the specified path.
Run the program with ./Proyecto_final.sh.
When the main menu appears, enter the option using a lowercase letter: a, b, c, d, e.
Each submenu contains numerical options that must be selected using (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) as needed.
If an option requires a parameter, it must be entered exactly as the name to be accessed.
The program uses variables in Spanish, so your Linux version must be set to the Spanish language.
To access a file or directory, provide the path from the root, e.g., /etc/passwd.
